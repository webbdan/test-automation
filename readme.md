# Test Automation - API

This syllabus is designed to teach API testing and automation from the ground up, using the Go application (test-api) as the dummy endpoint under test. The course assumes no prior knowledge of API testing and progresses from foundational concepts to advanced automation topics.

We'll be providing examples in TypeScript/Javascript, as well as Go, to show you how different languages can be used to achieve the same result.
